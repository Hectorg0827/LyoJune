# BUILD FIX STATUS - CURRENT SESSION

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Duplicate/Conflicting Types
- ✅ Removed duplicate `errorHandling()` method from ErrorHandlingViews.swift
- ✅ Fixed `selection()` method conflict in HapticManager.swift (renamed to `selectionFeedback()`)
- ✅ Fixed corrupted Story constructor in HeaderModels.swift sample data
- ✅ Added missing AuthError enum cases: `biometricNotEnrolled`, `tokenInvalid`
- ✅ Fixed LoginResponse.user type from UserProfile to User

### 2. Added Missing Mock Data Methods
- ✅ Added `Achievement.mockAchievements()` static method to AppModels.swift

### 3. Fixed Import Issues
- ✅ Added import comments to ModernComponents.swift and ModernLearnView.swift for AppModels access
- ✅ Updated selectionFeedback() method calls across DesignSystem files

### 4. Removed Remaining Duplicates
- ✅ Confirmed duplicate EnhancedTikTokVideoView removed from HomeFeedView.swift
- ✅ Confirmed duplicate ModernLoadingView removed from HomeFeedView.swift

## Current Status
- All major duplicate type conflicts resolved
- Missing enum cases added to AuthError
- Mock data methods implemented
- Import dependencies clarified

## Expected Remaining Issues
- Build cache may still contain stale error references
- Some type resolution may require clean build

## Next Steps
1. Clean build cache
2. Run fresh build to verify all fixes
3. Address any remaining compilation errors
4. Test basic functionality
