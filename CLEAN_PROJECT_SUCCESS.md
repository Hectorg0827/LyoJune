   - Preserved all original source code and assets

2. **Created Fresh Xcode Project**
   - Generated clean `LyoApp.xcodeproj` with proper UUID structure
   - Created valid project.pbxproj with correct build phases and configurations
   - Set up proper scheme and workspace files
   - Configured for iOS 17.5+ deployment target

3. **Restored Source Code Structure**
   - Copied all existing Swift source files from original LyoApp folder
   - Maintained proper folder hierarchy (App/, Core/, DesignSystem/, Features/, etc.)
   - Preserved Assets.xcassets and other resources
   - Added all files to proper build targets

### Current Project Status
