// NOTE: This file previously contained duplicate type definitions that have been consolidated 
// into Core/Shared/NetworkTypes.swift and other shared files.
// All types have been moved to their canonical locations.
// This file is kept for compatibility but contains no active definitions.

// Previously defined types have been moved to:
// - APIEndpoint, HTTPMethod -> Core/Shared/NetworkTypes.swift
// - EmptyRequest, EmptyResponse -> Core/Shared/APIModels.swift  
// - NetworkError -> Core/Shared/ErrorTypes.swift
// - CoreDataManager protocols -> (should be implemented elsewhere if needed)
