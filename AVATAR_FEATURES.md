Timer.scheduledTimer { self?.update() }

// After: Crash-safe
Timer.scheduledTimer { [weak self] _ in
    Task { @MainActor [weak self] in
        guard let self = self else { return }
        self.update()
    }
}
```

### Memory Management

- **Cleanup Methods**: Proper disposal of resources on deinit

### Animation Safety
- **State Validation**: Check animation state before updates
- **Bounded Values**: All animation values within safe ranges
- **Fallback Modes**: Graceful degradation if effects fail
