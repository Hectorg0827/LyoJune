# DesignSystem.swift Fix Report

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Invalid redeclaration errors in DesignSystem.swift
- `glassBorder` was declared twice
- `interactiveHover` was declared twice  
- `interactivePressed` was declared twice

**Solution**: Removed duplicate declarations from the first section, keeping the organized definitions in the "Glass effect colors" and "Interactive states" sections.

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/republicalatuya/Desktop/LyoJune/LyoApp/DesignSystem/DesignSystem.swift`

**Lines Removed**:
```swift
static let glassBorder = Color.white.opacity(0.2)
static let interactiveHover = DesignTokens.Colors.interactiveHover
static let interactivePressed = DesignTokens.Colors.interactivePressed
```

**Result**: Compilation errors resolved. The properties are now declared only once in their proper sections.

## Status
✅ Invalid redeclaration errors fixed
✅ Code compiles successfully
✅ No functionality lost - all properties remain available
